The most important aspect of any hospital management system will be the maintenance of patient records, medical history, staff records and the accounting information. This huge amount of information must be managed in a cost effective way so that there is no wastage of resources at hand. Despite being so complex it aims at ensuring data integrity and reducing inconsistencies. 
	Our application will mainly focus on patient information like his/her details and the doctor they were assigned to, based on their symptoms. The doctor will then diagnose the patient and prescribe some tests. These tests will be conducted in designated labs and each test will have an amount which will then be included in the final bill of the patient. All of this information for every patient is updated in real-time based on the attributes like number of days spent in the hospital, tests undergone, and drugs purchased etc. Apart from the details of the patient, this database also maintains the information of the medical and non-medical staff that work within the hospital.
